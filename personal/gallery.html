        <p>As a Two Sigma intern, I experimented with the documentation of
          the Halite AI game, which prompts players to build algorithms to conquer all the planets with their ships.
        The players are given many options in what kind of program they would like to create algorithms with.
      All ages can compete locally between schools, countries and companies. If you get on the leaderboard, there are benefits
    like skipping the initial interview round for a role at Two Sigma. </p>

        <p>I have been extremely dedicated to Step Up Women's Network for 4+ years now. The organization played a large role
          in my passion for female empowerment and helped boost my own confidence. I have had the opportunity to meet inspiring women
          leaders in various industries and feel confident about my own future career. The picture above is of me speaking at the annual Power Hour. </p>

    <p>As a TriBeCa Teaches Student, I had the opportunity to direct, film, edit and screen a documentary for the TriBeCa Film Festival.
      Working with a team of three, we were able to see our subject, Ramon Luna's, story from multiple angles. We highlighted the
    shared struggles of immigrating the New York City and the contradicting nature of believing a place will grant you
  endless opportunities; yet, feeling out of place in your new home.</p>
