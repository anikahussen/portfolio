<p id="writing">

The First Class Order of Merlin was green; thus, reflecting in the colors of
the Slytherin house. We tend to have a ad reputation based on the fact that
most of the Death Eaters and Voldemort's circle descended from Slytherin.
However, some great wizards and witches have also come out of Slytherin
(May we always remember Professor Severus Snape's life and sacrifice.) Our emblem is the serpent,
perfect representation of our skills and knowledge.
Yes, we know that there has been a number of prejudice wizards that have come
out of Slytherin and that we are obsessed with the Dark Arts (well, it is actually my
favorite subject). But that is not completely true, we are cunning and determined, but at the
end of the day, we are doing what we do best: winning. And yeah, people say that Griffindors and Slytherins are
two sides of the same coin, but I think they are trying way to hard to be us.

        Well, since I am American, I might as well talk about my Ilvermorny, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry in
        North America. Besides, although I love Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco and the British squad,
        I can not forget the amazing Newt Schamander and his fantastic beasts. Named bu Isolt Sayre, the background-repeathorned serpent, with a jewel input
        in its head, usually is seen as the mind of witch or a wizard. This is the house that favors scholars

<p id="writing">
The hummingbird is the creature/patronus tat you will never see coming.
They have high level of tactical skills , allowing
them to quickly sneak in and out. The otherside to them is there
beautiful designs and shapes in their wings,
which create an alluring effect. Many witches and
wizards have become obsessed with
catching the humming's charm.

A Patronus in general, is used through the Patronus Charm <i>Expecto Patronum </i>, which makes a water-like
spirit of your patronus to form. The light created by the patronus is extremely strong
and rare. Harry Potter has been able to succed on
several of his many tasks with his Patronus. They are
usually used to fight of the dementors, dark forved
beings.

<li>Unicorn hair core</li>
<li>10 3/4 in length</li>
<li>Reasonably Supple flexible</li>

</ul>
</h4>



    <p style="color:brown;font-size:34px;">Wood</p>   <p id="writing"> quality is fine-grained and white, and highly prized by all
    wand makers, because of its ivory component.

    The owners of the wand are usually good at duelingor
    has a destiny to become so. The Aspen is particularly known for matricial magic
    n infamous and secret dueling club in the 18th century,
    called The Silver Spears, were said to have owned many
    Aspen wands.
    Usually the owners are strong-minded and determined—usuall looking for quests and
    radical change in the world—for revolutionaries.


</p>

<p style="color:gray;font-size:34px;">Unicorn</p> <p id="writing"> hair has te most
consistent magic, rarely having any blockages. They usually get attached to their first owners
and, in turn, extremely loyal. They are the most difficult to turn towards
the Dark Arts. A downside is that they do not generally make powerfful wands(where the wood
may compensate) and they may become "melancholy" and die out if you used badly.
