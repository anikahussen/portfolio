<p id="pixartext">
  Cleverly weaved in together; the Pixar Theory suggests that all our favorite characters from Nemo and Merida to James P. Sullivan. First introduced by Jon Negroni, the theory lays out the timeline of all the Pixar released films, along with a greater message about humans, animals, and machines.
  If you look closely, the reoccurring hints tell that the stories do in fact exist in the same universe. Whether it be the Toys Story and Nemo shaped toys in Boo’s room in Monster’s Inc. or the reoccurring BNL logos like found on Buzz Lightyear’s batteries (we’ll get back to that later).


</p>
   <p id="pixartext">
  <b> The Good Dinosaur (pre-history) </b>
  (The actual beginning is The Good

  Dinosaur,
  where the asteroid misses earth, leaving dinosaurs to coexist with the humans. This is where the Pixar universe diverges from our own universe into an alternate universe).


  <b> Brave (10th century)</b>
  The main timeline ends and begins with Brave set in the Dark Ages of Scotland. It is the first time in the Pixar films the existence of human-like animals and magical inanimate objects is explained. The witch that Merida discovers plays a key role in the magic that allows all the fantastical events to occur. The witch is seen changing humans into animals, making brooms fly and opening portals to other realms.

  This magic on animals, humans, and things are key in the Pixar universe as all the movies exhibit either talking animals or stand-alone functioning machines. In fact, the ever-going evolutions of artificial intelligence, animals, and humans create a power struggle between the races for the rest of the timeline.

  <div class="flex-grid-thirds">
       <p id="pixartext"> <b>The Incredibles (1950s-1960s) </b>
The Incredibles movies occurring the 50’s is where you see the evolution of the human race into superhumans and the self-serving artificial intelligence overrules their superiors. Although the antagonist of the story is Syndrome with his AI creations like ‘Omnidroid’, he is soon overruled by his own creations. The power of the AI machines comes from the Zero Point energy vacuum.
<b>Toy Story (1995-1999)</b>
The toys in the first two Toy Story movies draw from the technological powers established in The Incredibles. They realize that when toys are isolated from humans, they become inanimate objects again. This creates a dilemma in the power struggle between machine and humans. Even when they would like to take over the world from humans, they know that human love is needed for their own existence.
<b>Finding Nemo/Dory (2003)</b>
In Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, we learn that the humans are excessively polluting the Earth and animals have grown extreme intelligence. The animals have been experimented on, leading to memory loss in Dory. We also see the physical resentment between the dentist and Nemo’s friends, fueling the battle between the humans and animals.
<b>Coco (2006) </b>
Coco gives a key explanation of what fuels the energy and life of the earth: memory. The main lesson in the movie is that the inhabitants in the land of the dead continue to exist only if people in the real world continue to remember them. (This will later tie into Inside Out, where emotions seem to be the power source of life, but actually, the memories of the emotions are the foundation of all power). As long as one orb of the dead one’s memory lives on in one’s head, the dead still exist. It is key to notice the imagery of Riley’s mind in Inside Out resembles the city of the dead in Coco.
Ratattouille (2007)
In Ratatouille, we see the evolution and control animals have over humans. Remy the rat learns that he is an expert in cooking, a skill specifically meant for humans, and control Linguini throughout the whole movie, especially as the chef does not know how to do anything. Humans are becoming far more reliant on animals (and machines). Even though Remy despises humans, he still associates with them since, he, too, is reliant upon them.
</p>

<p id="pixartext">
<b>Inside Out (2007)</b>
We delve into the power of emotions in Inside Out, as we venture inside of Riley’s mind. We see that joy has become dominant as most of her memories are bright yellow, along with all her core memories.

We also see that Riley’s childhood imaginary friend disappears as Riley starts to forget Bing Bong. Memory, yet again, plays a role.

 emotion evolution[/caption]


The toys continue to learn about the growing hatred between humans and toys. Although Woody and his friends have loved Andy, their owner, Lotso the Huggin’ Bear grows intense hatred for the abandonment he faced. Andy also begins to forget about his own toys and they fear they will seize to live the way they have. Meanwhile, Carl and Ellie of Up try to tell Andy to get rid of his toys because they know about the growing war between machines and human (as you can see on Andy’s board: postcards from Carl and Ellie). In fact, that is why the couple lives alone.
<b>Up (2011-2016)<b>
Buy N Large (BnL) makes a larger appearance in Up, as it is the corporation that forces Carl to move his house out of his neighborhood. With technologically enhanced collars, Carl realizes that animals can communicate with humans. He goes on to train the dogs.
<b>Cars (2100-2200)</b>
As animals gained more power over the humans, the machines helped save the humans, leading to the success of humans (or machines, if you want to see it that way). Earth had become unbalanced with the abundance of enhanced species. So, a bunch of humans was sent to space on the Axiom ship (Wall-E storyline), while the rest stayed to populate the Earth (Cars storyline)

There is an energy crisis (Watch Out For This Phrase!) on Earth and Allinol, an oil company run by BnL, drives Earth to extreme pollution and non-sustainable. It is important to note that it may seem as the cars are running on their own, but they still need humans to help them run. In fact, they take on the memory and characters of their previous owners as their own personalities.
<b>Wall-E (2800-2900)</b>
Unable to live on Earth for a hundred years, BnL has taken over Axiom in Wall-E. Instead of a brutal takeover, the machines tend to the humans’ every need like mindless robots. This is because even with all the power, the machines are still extremely reliant on human life. Wall-E retains his personality because of his fascination with human culture and relationship with a cockroach. He goes on to save Earth, planting the first tree in a hundred years on Earth. Memory comes into play again as Earth populate with tiny plants as the humans start top remember Earth.
</p>
<p id="pixartext">
<b>A Bug's Life (2898-3000) </b>
The first tree that Wall-E had planted had expanded into much more in A Bug’s Life. With the mutated genes, insects can live far longer now and have grown vast civilizations far in the future. Humans are very rare, but we are about to see another drastic evolution.
Monsters Inc./University (4500-5000)
Hundreds of years later, either by the radiation caused by BnL or breeding between highly intelligent animals and humans, animals evolve into…Monsters. In Monster’s University, we learn that humans were accidentally wiped out and the monsters are taught that humans are toxic. The only way to reach them is through doors that open to different realms. However, this is all false.
In Monsters Inc., we see the monsters are going through an energy crisis (!!!) where the fear of children is not enough to sustain them. Remember, even with humans non-existent, monsters still need to live off the emotions and memories of humans. So, the doors to children’s bedrooms are not opening to another realm, but in the past: acting as a time portal to a time human did exist. They are, in fact, going through an energy crisis because of the cycle the monsters are currently on. Time in the Monster world moves parallel with the time in the past. So, when they were feeding off fear in…let’s say…in the Dark Ages of Brave, fear was far more prevalent with the events occurring in the world.

However, as BnL and the machines made life far more comfortable for the humans, joy becomes more prevalent, as you see in Riley’s head in Inside Out. That is why Sully finds out that laughter is a far more powerful energy source (or battery). Boo’s time is right before Toy Story 3, as you can spot her in Sunnyside Daycare and a Jessie toy in her room.

Boo, the girl in the pigtails, is a critical part of the Pixar timeline. Losing her childhood monster friend, Sully, at a young age, she is never able to get over the loss. She spends the rest of her life studying and experimenting with portals and myths, stumbling upon magic.

There she finds that there are time portals, which she travels through in search of Sully. However, she never really finds him, getting stuck in the Dark Ages of Scotland.


You can even see carvings of a creature that has an uncanny resemblance to Sully.
Boo…is the crazy witch Merida seeks out.
