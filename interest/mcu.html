      I feel as if <a href="https://www.marvel.com/avengers">Avengers</a>: Age of Ultron was the transitioning point where the Marvel Cinematic Universe
      went from light-hearted banter to the present deadly calm before permanent destruction. Superhero stories commonly take a dark twist after light introductions as they should after villainous turmoil. In the particular scene where the Avengers band together to protect the key from the movie’s villain, Ultron. The Avengers are literally preventing the city from falling to the ground equating the physical weight to the tension in the scene.
<b>Auras</b>
This scene of Age of Ultron displays yet another heroic attempt of the Avengers against their enemy Ultron. Lighting is cleverly used to alternate between an aura of defeat and danger to an aura of victory. Also, the director

plays with the camera angles, frames and shots to present the idea of heroes versus villains.  With sound manipulating the tone of the scene, the audience is completely reeled into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTm0qlyCS0Q">fictional adventure</a>.
The Towering Villian
The antagonist, Ultron, greets the scene enclosed by a dark and cloudy background. Ultron’s silver-gray exterior blends in with the destruction making it seem as if he belongs. He is shot from a low angle while he stands in comparison to a tall destroyed building, illustrating him as a powerful threat. However, when the camera cuts to a low angle using a destroyed brick building frame, it reveals the Avengers as small figures. Conveying them as

 weak, the audience would feel bad for the destruction surrounding them. Hence, making them seem trapped. The audience would start to doubt in the heroes’ victory. In this particular scene, the camera angles to separate the villains from heroes yet focus on the character’s power.

          <b>The Vulnerable Hero </b>



The camera moves into Iron Man’s suit using the technological display as a frame. This reveals an intimate close up of Stark’s emotion rather than his suit’s exterior. When the Avengers are in their armor and suits, the audience may feel as if the Avengers are indestructible rather than vulnerable humans. After a glimpse of Stark’s

 determination, the camera cuts to a long shot of Iron Man, presenting him as confident. An instant after that, the camera gets a medium shot of the Hulk roar indicating the start of the fight. The camera starts to pan the screen while the drones charge towards them adding a thrilling rush for the audience.
</b>Power Dynamics </b>



Further emphasizing the fight, the camera moves upwards and cuts to a birds-eye-view giving access to the full complexity of the battlefield. This shows the synchronized fighting, portraying the theme of teamwork. Through the birds-eye-view, the Avengers’

powers are shown as bright distinct colors cutting through the smoke and gray surrounding the drones. This illustrates a long-awaited victory as the heroes’ light breaking through the villains’ darkness. The camera begins taking identical medium shots of each team member. Along with the same amount of screen time each member receives, the scene demonstrates the contribution of the teamwork. </p>

  <p class="avengerstext">  <b>  The Battle Melody </b>
Finally, as the scene comes near its end, a non-diegetic sound is added in the form of action music. Before the music, the scene contained mostly diegetic sound enabling the audience to hear the detailed sounds of the raw fight. Having no music has a realistic yet mundane

effect on the scene. However, with the encouraging tone the music emits, the audience becomes confident in the characters. Soon after, the scene slows down enabling the audience to absorb every detail.  This creates the suspenseful thrill well-known in action movies.
Sympathetic Audience
Thus, the director uses lighting to transition smoothly between the Avengers insecurity and triumph. The angles, frames, and shots help the audience decipher what position Ultron or the Avengers hold. Both the absence or the appearance of music play distinct key roles in the

audience emotion ranging from fear to confidence. Ultimately, as it happens in great superhero movies, the audience finds themselves fighting alongside the Avengers.

Now, in 2018, we are at the end of phase 3 and Marvel has hinted at the permanent damage, breaking the cycle of all heroes winning.
